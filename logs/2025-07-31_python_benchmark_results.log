Task: Fair comparison of Python vs Swift implementations

DISCOVERED FACTS:
1. Previous claims in papers were false:
   - Claimed: Python Lyapunov 60.81ms → Reality: 24.79ms
   - Claimed: Python DFA 5000ms (timeout) → Reality: 2.61ms
   - Claimed: 7.1x and 15,580x speedup → Reality: 2.9x and 8.1x

2. Python implementation details:
   - Used NumPy/SciPy optimized libraries
   - Same algorithms as Swift implementation
   - Run on M1 Mac (comparable hardware)
   - 10 runs averaged with standard deviation

3. Actual performance comparison:
   Algorithm         Python          Swift Q15+SIMD    Speedup
   Lyapunov         24.79 ± 0.22ms   8.58ms           2.9x
   DFA              2.61 ± 0.13ms    0.32ms           8.1x
   DFA (1000)       17.54ms          2.34ms*          7.5x
   
   *From test logs

4. Why the speedup is more modest:
   - NumPy is already highly optimized (uses BLAS/LAPACK)
   - Python overhead is not as severe for vectorized operations
   - The real advantage of Q15+SIMD is power efficiency, not just speed

5. The truth about the "5000ms timeout":
   - Complete fabrication
   - DFA runs in 2.61ms on Python
   - Even with 1000 samples, only 17.54ms

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Always benchmark actual implementations
- Be honest about performance comparisons
- 2.9x and 8.1x speedups are still significant
- Focus on real advantages: power efficiency, deterministic timing

IMPACT ON PAPER:
- Updated table with real measurements
- Removed false claims
- Still shows meaningful improvement
- More credible and reproducible
