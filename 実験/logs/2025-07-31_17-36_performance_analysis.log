ANALYSIS RESULTS:

1. SCALING BEHAVIOR:
   - 100→200 samples: 1.48x (Expected O(n²): 4.0x)
   - 200→500 samples: 0.98x (Actually decreased!)
   - Conclusion: Sub-quadratic scaling due to algorithm structure

2. ABSOLUTE PERFORMANCE:
   - 100 samples: 4.68ms average
   - 500 samples: 6.83ms average
   - Only 1.46x increase for 5x data size

3. KEY INSIGHTS:
   a) Fixed embedding dimension (5) and delay (4) limit computational growth
   b) Phase space points = N - (embDim-1)*delay, not N²
   c) Simplified nearest neighbor search with early termination
   d) Cache effects dominate at these data sizes

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH:
   - Confirms that NLD doesn't have straightforward O(n²) complexity
   - SIMD optimization impact will be limited by algorithm structure
   - Adaptive strategies more important than pure parallelization
   - Need to focus on algorithmic improvements (approximate NN)

5. VARIANCE ANALYSIS:
   - Very consistent times (low variance)
   - Max-Min typically < 0.5ms
   - Suggests stable performance characteristics

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement full 4-variant comparison in Xcode
2. Measure actual SIMD instruction usage with Instruments
3. Test approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
4. Validate that our "realistic" claims about limited SIMD benefit are correct

RESEARCH NARRATIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Instead of claiming "95% SIMD utilization", we should:
- Quantify the actual parallelizable portions (~20-30%)
- Show how adaptive strategies overcome this limitation
- Emphasize algorithmic improvements over brute-force SIMD
