EXPERIMENT SUMMARY:
Successfully executed basic performance measurements using a simplified Lyapunov exponent implementation.

RESULTS:
Data Size | Avg Time (ms) | Min Time (ms) | Max Time (ms)
----------|---------------|---------------|---------------
50        | 0.00         | 0.00         | 0.00
100       | 4.68         | 4.61         | 4.78  
200       | 6.94         | 6.75         | 7.10
500       | 6.83         | 6.74         | 6.96
1000      | (not tested - only 800 samples available)

OBSERVATIONS:
1. 50 samples is too small to measure accurately (0ms)
2. Processing time doesn't scale linearly with data size
3. 100→200 samples shows increase, but 200→500 shows slight decrease
4. This suggests cache effects or algorithm overhead dominating at small sizes

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. Cannot run full Swift implementation outside Xcode project context
2. Need to compile within Xcode to access all implementation variants
3. Type definitions (Q15, etc.) need to be included in standalone scripts

NEXT STEPS:
1. Open Xcode project and run RunExperiment.swift properly
2. Use Instruments for SIMD utilization measurement
3. Compare all 4 implementations (scalar, SIMD-only, adaptive-only, proposed)
4. Measure actual SIMD utilization rates

NOTE:
This simplified test provides baseline measurements but doesn't include:
- SIMD optimizations
- Adaptive scaling engine
- Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
- Actual implementation variants comparison
